# Exercise Lab 2: Calculating the Salary

# Step 1: Assign the given constant values
reg_hours = 40
reg_rate = 18.25
ov_rate = 27.78

# Step 2: Input work hours
workhours = int(input("Enter your work hours: "))

# Step 3: Calculate the overtime hours
overtime_hours = workhours - reg_hours

# Step 4: Calculate the regular wage
regular_wage = reg_hours * reg_rate

# Step 5: Calculate the overtime wage
overtime_wage = overtime_hours * ov_rate

# Step 6: Calculate total wage
total_wage = regular_wage + overtime_wage

# Step 7: Display the results
print("Regular Charge:", regular_wage)
print("Overtime Charge:", overtime_wage)
print("Total wage:", total_wage)

Enter your work hours: 50

Regular Charge: 730.0
Overtime Charge: 277.8
Total wage: 1007.8
