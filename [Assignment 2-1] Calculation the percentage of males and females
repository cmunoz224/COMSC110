# Ask for user input
male = int(input("Enter number of male students: "))
female = int(input("Enter number of female students: "))
non_binary = int(input("Enter number of non-binary students: "))

# Calculate total number of students
total = male + female + non_binary

# Calculate percentages
m_perc = (male / total) * 100
f_perc = (female / total) * 100
nb_perc = (non_binary / total) * 100

# Output results
print("The total number of students:", total)
print("The number of males, females, and non-binary:")
print(male, female, non_binary)
print("The percentage of males, females, and non-binary:")
print(f"{m_perc:.2f}%\t{f_perc:.2f}%\t{nb_perc:.2f}%")
